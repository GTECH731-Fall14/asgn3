## Mara Gittleman
## Assignment 3

##Use an object-oriented approach for the following problem:
##1. Allow a user to enter a series of geometric object such as circles, squares, triangles, elipses
##2. Write a program that takes this list of geometric objects and calculates the cumulative area of all of the object
##3. Try adding an new geometric object not in your original list
##4. How easy or hard was it to add?

### 3 - I added rectangle. To do so, I had to create the class, 
# and then add it as one of the options in addShape and chooseOption. 
### 4 - It wasn't hard, but if it was a more complicated program, I could try
# re-doing it so I wasn't hard-coding the input for each individual shape.
